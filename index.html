          <p class="bio"> My name is Lucas and I'm 16 years old. My favorite activity is to skateboard. I am from Brazil and I've been living in the United States for the last six years. I realized I enjoyed programming because while many people thought it was really boring and stressful, I can easily do it for long periods of time, and I enjoy learning new things about it while doing it.</p>
